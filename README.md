# Moodeng

A **self-hosted, local-first notes app**.

- Your notes are saved **locally in your browser** (no cloud by default).
- Runs as a simple web app you can host anywhere.
- Made for fast writing: folders/collections, markdown editing, search, and themes.

## Why

I wanted a notes app that feels lightweight and private:

- **Local-based**: your data stays on your device.
- **Self-hosted**: you control where the app is served from.
- **Simple**: open it and start writing.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Preview the build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Notes about storage

Moodeng stores your notes in a **local browser database**. If you clear your browser site data, your notes may be removed.
